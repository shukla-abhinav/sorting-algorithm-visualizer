# Sorting Algorithm Visualization Desktop App

## Overview
The Sorting Algorithm Visualization Desktop App is built using Python with the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface. It allows users to visually understand the workings of three sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. Each algorithm is implemented in a separate Python script for clarity and modularity.

## Features
1. **Bubble Sort Visualization:** Demonstrates the step-by-step sorting process of Bubble Sort, highlighting the comparison and swapping of elements.
   
2. **Merge Sort Visualization:** Illustrates the recursive divide-and-conquer strategy of Merge Sort, showing how arrays are split and merged back in sorted order.
   
3. **Quick Sort Visualization:** Shows the partitioning and recursive sorting process of Quick Sort, emphasizing the selection of pivot elements and partitioning of subarrays.

## Implementation Details
- **bubbleSort.py:** Implements the Bubble Sort algorithm. It iterates through the list multiple times, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
  
- **mergesort.py:** Implements the Merge Sort algorithm. It recursively divides the list into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together in sorted order.
  
- **quicksort.py:** Implements the Quick Sort algorithm. It selects a pivot element, partitions the list into elements smaller than the pivot and larger than the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

## User Interface
The Tkinter GUI provides a simple and intuitive interface:
- **Sorting Options:** Users can select the sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, or Quick Sort) from a dropdown menu.
  
- **Start Button:** Initiates the visualization of the selected sorting algorithm on a randomly generated array of integers.

- **Speed Control:** Allows users to adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process at different rates.

## Usage
1. **Requirements:** Ensure Python and Tkinter are installed on the system.
   
2. **Execution:** Run the main application file to launch the desktop app. Select a sorting algorithm and click "Start" to begin the visualization.

3. **Observation:** Observe the graphical representation of the sorting algorithm's execution, including comparisons, swaps, and recursive calls where applicable.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the visualization with additional graphical elements to highlight key steps in each algorithm.
- Implement more sorting algorithms to provide a comprehensive learning tool.
- Integrate real-time performance metrics and analysis for each algorithm.

## Conclusion
The Sorting Algorithm Visualization Desktop App provides an interactive learning experience for understanding and comparing Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. It combines educational value with practical demonstration, making it a valuable tool for both beginners and experienced programmers.
